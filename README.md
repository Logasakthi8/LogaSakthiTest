# 1) Mention the working of Internet Website in Terms of Front-end & Back-end Divisions
An internet website consists of two main parts: the front-end and the back-end.

Front-end: It is the client-side of the website that users interact with directly. It includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the website's appearance and interactivity.

Back-end: It is the server-side of the website that handles data processing and storage. It involves server technologies, application logic, and databases to manage requests, perform operations, and store data.

The front-end communicates with the back-end through HTTP requests and responses, enabling user interactions and data retrieval.

Overall, the front-end focuses on the website's interface and user experience, while the back-end manages data, logic, and server operations.
# 2) What are tags in HTML? Explain the each category of tag with an Example.

Tags in HTML are elements used to structure and format web page content. Here are the main categories of HTML tags:

Opening and Closing Tags: These tags mark the beginning and end of an element.

Self-Closing Tags: These tags represent elements that don't require a closing tag.

Attribute Tags: These tags provide additional information or modify the behavior of an element.

Meta Tags: These tags provide metadata about the web page.

Semantic Tags: These tags give meaning to the content and help define its structure.

These categories encompass the different types of tags used in HTML to create and organize web page content.

# 3) Explain the working Procedure of Virtual DOM

The Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) is a concept used in JavaScript frameworks like React to optimize the rendering process and improve performance in web applications. Here's an overview of how the Virtual DOM works:

Initial Render:
When a web application built with a framework like React starts, it creates a virtual representation of the HTML called the Virtual DOM. This Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual browser DOM.

Virtual DOM Tree:
The Virtual DOM consists of a tree-like structure where each element corresponds to a component or element in the actual browser DOM. This tree mirrors the structure of the user interface and holds information about each component's properties and state.

Rendering Changes:
When changes occur in the application's state or props, React re-renders the components. Instead of directly modifying the browser DOM, React performs the changes on the Virtual DOM first.

Virtual DOM Diffing:
After re-rendering, React compares the new Virtual DOM tree with the previous version to determine the differences. This process is called Virtual DOM diffing or reconciliation.

Calculating Minimal Updates:
React analyzes the differences in the Virtual DOM and calculates the minimal set of changes needed to update the actual browser DOM. This step optimizes performance by avoiding unnecessary manipulations to the real DOM.

Updating the Real DOM:
React applies the calculated changes to the actual browser DOM, updating only the necessary elements. This process is typically more efficient than directly manipulating the entire DOM tree.

Repaint and Layout:
The browser performs a repaint and layout process to reflect the changes made to the DOM. However, since React minimizes the number of DOM updates, this step is faster and more efficient than it would be without the Virtual DOM.

By leveraging the Virtual DOM, React optimizes the rendering process by reducing the number of direct manipulations to the browser DOM. This approach results in improved performance and a smoother user experience for web applications.

# 4) Mention some Differences between MySQL and No SQL

MySQL and NoSQL are two different types of database management systems. Here are some key differences between them:

Data Model:
MySQL: MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) based on the relational data model. It organizes data into tables with predefined schemas, where relationships between tables are established using keys.
NoSQL: NoSQL databases, on the other hand, provide a flexible data model. They are often categorized into key-value stores, document stores, column-family stores, or graph databases. NoSQL databases allow for dynamic and schema-less data storage.
Scalability:
MySQL: MySQL databases typically scale vertically, meaning they are scaled by adding more resources to a single server, such as CPU, memory, or storage. It has limitations in handling large-scale data and high traffic loads.
NoSQL: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, which involves adding more servers to distribute the data and workload. They offer better scalability for large and distributed systems, handling massive amounts of data and high traffic with ease.
Data Structure:
MySQL: MySQL databases have structured data with predefined schemas. Data is organized into tables with rows and columns, and relationships between tables are defined by foreign keys.
NoSQL: NoSQL databases can handle structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. They allow for flexible data schemas, making them suitable for handling dynamic and evolving data.
Query Language:
MySQL: MySQL uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for defining and manipulating data. It supports complex queries, joins, and transactions.
NoSQL: NoSQL databases often have their query languages specific to their data models. For example, MongoDB uses a query language based on JavaScript, and Cassandra uses CQL (Cassandra Query Language).
ACID Compliance:
MySQL: MySQL is typically ACID-compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), ensuring data integrity and reliability. It provides transaction support for maintaining data consistency.
NoSQL: NoSQL databases often sacrifice some ACID properties for scalability and performance. Some NoSQL databases offer eventual consistency, where data consistency is achieved over time rather than immediately.
It's important to note that MySQL and NoSQL databases have different strengths and use cases. MySQL is commonly used for structured data and complex queries, while NoSQL databases excel in handling large-scale, distributed, and flexible data requirements. The choice between the two depends on the specific needs of the application or system.

# 5) Explain any one DBMS Technology in your own words.

One widely used DBMS (Database Management System) technology is PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is an open-source, object-relational database system known for its robustness, reliability, and advanced features. It provides a powerful and scalable solution for managing and organizing large amounts of structured and unstructured data.

PostgreSQL offers a wide range of features, including:

Data Integrity: PostgreSQL ensures data integrity through constraints, such as unique, not null, and foreign key constraints. It enforces rules and ensures that the data stored in the database follows specified criteria, maintaining data accuracy and consistency.

Advanced Data Types: In addition to the standard data types (e.g., integer, text, boolean), PostgreSQL offers an extensive range of specialized data types, including arrays, JSON, XML, spatial data, and more. These advanced data types allow for efficient storage and retrieval of complex and diverse data structures.

Extensibility: PostgreSQL allows users to define their own data types, operators, and functions. This extensibility allows for customization and tailoring of the database to specific application requirements. Users can create custom data types and functions to handle domain-specific data and operations efficiently.

Concurrency Control: PostgreSQL employs a multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) mechanism, allowing multiple transactions to access the database simultaneously without conflicts. This ensures high concurrency and transaction isolation while maintaining data consistency.

Advanced Querying: PostgreSQL supports complex queries, including joins, subqueries, and window functions. It also provides advanced indexing mechanisms, such as B-tree, hash, and GIN (Generalized Inverted Index), for optimizing query performance.

Replication and High Availability: PostgreSQL offers various replication mechanisms, including asynchronous and synchronous replication, to ensure data redundancy and high availability. It allows for creating hot standby servers that can seamlessly take over in case of a primary server failure.

Security: PostgreSQL provides robust security features, including role-based access control (RBAC), SSL encryption, and data encryption at rest. It allows fine-grained control over user permissions and ensures data privacy and protection.

Overall, PostgreSQL is a feature-rich DBMS technology that combines the benefits of a relational database with advanced features and extensibility. Its stability, scalability, and adherence to standards make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from small-scale projects to large enterprise systems.
